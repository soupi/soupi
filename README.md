Hi, I'm Gil.

My GitHub account mainly focuses on tutorials, learning resources, example projects, and contributions to other open-source projects.

If you are interested in my personal software projects,
you might want to check my Gitea instance ([vcs.gilmi.net](https://vcs.gilmi.net)) instead.

To find out more about me, visit my website: [gilmi.net](https://gilmi.net).
